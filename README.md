# IMPORTANT:

I am no long continuing the series.

This is because I have came to realise the code of the series wasn't good, and so I didn't want to encourage bad practices when people
go to create their own conent, so I felt it was best to simply unlist the videos and discontune the seires.

The series can still be views in the link below, if you really want to see it.

Sorry :(
